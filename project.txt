FOOD DELIVERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DSA PROJECT)
================================================================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
This project is a comprehensive Console-based Food Delivery Management System developed in C++. 
It simulates a real-world food delivery ecosystem connecting Customers, Restaurants, and Delivery Agents. 
The system utilizes efficient Data Structures and Algorithms to manage data, optimize routes, and handle operations.

2. KEY FEATURES
---------------
[Customer Portal]
- User Registration & Login (Secure ID mapping)
- Browse Restaurants & Menus
- Place Orders (Real-time processing)
- View Order History (LIFO access)
- Interactive Delivery Map (Visualizing location)

[Restaurant Portal]
- Manage Menu Items (Add/Update)
- View & Process Pending Orders (FIFO processing)
- Categorized Restaurant Management

[Delivery Portal]
- Manage Delivery Agents
- Assign Agents to Active Orders
- Route Optimization

[System & Analytics]
- View Active Orders
- City Map Visualization (ASCII Art)
- Shortest Path Calculation (Navigation)
- Network Optimization (MST)

3. DATA STRUCTURES USED
-----------------------
The project demonstrates the practical application of the following data structures:

1. LINKED LIST
   - Used for: Storing Restaurants, Menu Items, and Delivery Agents.
   - Reason: Dynamic size, easy insertion/deletion.

2. STACK (LIFO)
   - Used for: Customer Order History.
   - Reason: Users typically want to see their most recent orders first.

3. QUEUE (FIFO)
   - Used for: Order Processing (Global Order Queue & Restaurant Pending Queue).
   - Reason: Orders should be processed in the order they are received (First-Come-First-Serve).

4. HASH TABLE
   - Used for: Customer Management (Login/Lookup).
   - Reason: Provides O(1) average time complexity for looking up customers by ID/Phone.

5. GRAPH (ADJACENCY LIST)
   - Used for: City Map representation.
   - Reason: Efficiently represents cities (nodes) and distances (edges) for route calculations.

6. HEAP (PRIORITY QUEUE)
   - Used for: Dijkstra's Algorithm.
   - Reason: Efficiently fetching the nearest city during shortest path calculation.

7. UNION-FIND (DISJOINT SET)
   - Used for: Kruskal's Algorithm (MST).
   - Reason: Efficiently managing connected components to detect cycles.

4. ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED
-------------------------
1. DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
   - Purpose: Finding the shortest path between two cities (e.g., Restaurant to Customer).
   - Application: Delivery route optimization.

2. PRIM'S & KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM
   - Purpose: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
   - Application: Optimizing the delivery network to connect all locations with minimum cost/distance.

3. SEARCHING ALGORITHMS
   - Linear Search: Finding items in small lists (e.g., Menu items).
   - Binary Search: Optimized searching in sorted datasets.

4. SORTING ALGORITHMS
   - Quick Sort / Merge Sort: Sorting arrays for efficient searching or display.
